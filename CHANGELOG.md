# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Walkthroughs work in Remote Development / Split Mode (JetBrains Gateway): with the plugin
  installed on both the Host and the JetBrains Client, file and diff walkthroughs, follow-up
  questions, history replay and Markdown export all work while the agent talks to the Host's MCP
  server.

### Changed

- The minimum supported IDE version is now IntelliJ IDEA 2026.2.

### Fixed

- Closing a diff tab that a diff walkthrough popup is attached to now closes the popup instead of
  leaving it stuck over the editor and breaking repaints.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Diff walkthrough steps now support `endLine` ranges and point their connector at the beginning
  of a line when the popup is positioned to its left. (PR #80)

### Fixed

- The question input cursor is visible when using the IDEA color scheme. (PR #80)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Walkthrough steps anchored to a file can now identify a range of consecutive lines by adding an
  `endLine` field alongside `line`, instead of only pointing at a single line (#50).

### Changed

- Ranged file walkthrough steps now mark the mentioned code with a curly brace and point the
  connector at that brace, without changing the editor's text selection (#55).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- The walkthrough popup now uses IDEA styling by default, including the active appearance theme's
  colors, typography, native controls, and rounded corners; the animated background is disabled for
  this style. (PR #79)
- The walkthrough connector is thinner and now meets the arrowhead at its base for a cleaner arrow.
  (PR #79)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- `show_walkthrough_items` and `show_diff_walkthrough_items` accept an optional `historyId`
  parameter to overwrite an existing walkthrough history record in place instead of creating a
  new one, so iterating on a walkthrough's content no longer clutters the project history (#49).

### Fixed

- Passing an empty or `null` items payload to the walkthrough MCP tools now returns a clear
  "items must not be empty" error instead of failing with an internal error.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- A **Tools → Walkthrough → Export Walkthrough to Markdown…** action that saves any walkthrough from
  the project history as a shareable Markdown document, with each step (and its follow-up answer
  steps) rendered as a section annotated with its source location (PR #37).
  
### Fixed

- Dragging or resizing a walkthrough popup that overlaps the editor tab bar no longer reorders the
  tabs underneath (#38).

## [0.4.1]

### Added

- Improved linting and quality tooling configuration (PR #33).

### Fixed

- Stepping between diff walkthrough items now reuses the already-open diff viewer instead of
  opening a new tab (PR #32).
- The popup no longer briefly flashes the "agent is not listening" warning when the MCP client
  cancels and immediately re-issues a question wait (PR #31).
- Answer steps inserted via follow-up questions are now persisted to walkthrough history and
  restored when the walkthrough is reopened (#34, PR #35).

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- It's now possible to attach walkthrough items to diff views by asking the agent for PR or changes review (#29)

### Fixed

- The popup now shows the agent status if it's not listening to user questions (#27)

## [0.3.2]

### Fixed

- Popup location and size are now preserved.
- Popup size is increased and the layout is improved.

## [0.3.1]

### Fixed

- Popup no longer jumps after appearing; it now opens at its final position and keeps the
  target line clear of the popup body (#19).
- Replaced `runReadActionBlocking` with `WriteIntentReadAction` to avoid read-action assertions
  when navigating between walkthrough steps (#17).
- Only one walkthrough popup is visible at a time; previous sessions are disposed when a new one
  starts (#16).

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Users can ask follow-up questions from a walkthrough step. Agents can wait for those questions
  and insert clarifying answer steps back into the walkthrough.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Per-project walkthrough history callable via a hotkey (#10).
- Settings with selectable color palettes for the popups (#11).

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with high CPU usage (#6).

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- MCP tool `show_walkthrough_items` for programmatic walkthrough guidance
- Compose-based popup UI with markdown rendering and line-anchored connector
